                    There is a shifting trend in scientific research, traditionally driven by conceptual development, it is
                    recently being more influenced by technological development. Technological progress, particularly in the
                    form of machine learning models is opening a new approach to research, the data-driven approach. As the
                    approach to science changes, so does the trust we can place in it changes.

                    Science is an epistemic system, a knowledge generating system. Through the scientific method, it seeks
                    to generate collectively empirically verified knowledge based on a positivistic principal of knowledge:
                    that knowledge is valid only if it can be empirically verified. This is in contrast with the
                    knowledge-generating systems of religion, which tries to generate knowledge of non-physically verifiable
                    phenomena. The trust we place in the knowledge produced by these institutions differ, because their
                    methods of producing knowledge differ.
