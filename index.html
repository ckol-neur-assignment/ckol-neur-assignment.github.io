                There is a shifting trend in scientific research, traditionally driven by conceptual development, it is recently being more influenced by technological development. Technological progress, particularly in the form of machine learning models is opening a new approach to research, the data-driven approach. As the approach to science changes, so does the trust we can place in it changes.

                Science is an epistemic system, or a knowledge generating system. Through the scientific method, it seeks to generate collectively empirically verified knowledge based on a positivistic principal of knowledge: that knowledge is valid only if it can be empirically verified. This is in contrast with the knowledge-generating systems of religion, which tries to generate knowledge of non-physically verifiable phenomena. The trust we place in the knowledge produced by these institutions differ, because their methods of producing knowledge differ.

                    It has been argued, that the purpose of science is not to generate knowledge, but rather improve society. This is could be described as an instrumentalist approach, where the validity of knowledge is less a concern than the utility of knowledge. However, this is not reflected in real scientific practices. In drug discovery for instance, during randomized control trials a placebo condition is common-practice. We care that the drug works, not just by placebo, but by pharmacological activity. It is demonstrated, that science cannot be explained as having a purely instrumentalist goal of utility, but it has an epistemic goal of actual knowledge as well.

                The epistemic validity, or "truthfulness" of the knowledge is determined by a number of procedures we have developed around the scientific method. This includes peer review; a collective democratization of knowledge generation and statistical testing; mathematical verification of probability. (other examples exist) This is built around the concept driven approach to knowledge generation: hypothesis to experiment and control to observation. New concepts and theories are generated, and increase in likelihood of truth as a body of evidence is gathered.

                But as a knowledge generating system, if the processes and approaches used to generate the knowledge
                change, so does the epistemic validity (our trust). Additionally, the procedures needed to protect the
                validity of the knowledge, such as statistical-testing, need to change as well. We will look at these
                changes in science, and how they effect the validity of the knowledge produced.

                the field of research is not autonomous, it is subject to external forces and influence. Whether it be
                administrative, from the university, or regulatory from the government. Most external influence; whether
                administrative, or regulatory, is in some way market influence (with the interests of the market being
                reflected in both regulation and administration). There are economic realities science has to face, it
                is very expensive
                <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/ch/en/Industries/life-sciences-health-care/research/measuring-return-from-pharmaceutical-innovation.html"> (see here) </a>.
                We see this with the increase in expenditure on R/D from private companies (10x in 2010, from what it
                was in the 1980s) (https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57126). These economic realities, and the need for
                funding (often private) create an external influence on research. You research what you can get funding
                for.

                The market we should focus on the most is big tech. Technological developments have always aided
                conceptual development. Whether it be the light microscope, opening the world of the microscopic, or
                CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies opening a new world in genomics. The tech industry, seems to
                in particular have a reciprocal relationship with science.

                Neuroscience is represented in the tech industry. With companies such as Neura-link, both a product of,
                but corporate influence on neuroscience research. The influence of big-tech deserves attention, as big
                tech has a very unique culture and logic. That of "innovation,  every start up, every CEO must be a
                genius, a revolutionary. With big emphasis on "disrupting" the market. They promise innovation,
                revolution, and progress ([[NEUR421-Assignment-WhatTechCallsThinking.pdf]]). If we are to contrast this
                with the pharmaceutical market, we'll see that the pharmaceutical market is much more conservative.
                Naturally, people are alot more cautious about what medicine they take, and there is a dense body of
                legislation and regulation around drug development.

                    The culture of innovation compounds in effect with the culture of genius in big-tech. A sort of
                    exceptionalism about the CEO/founder. This is oriented both externally in marketing
                    (Elizabeth Holmes, and Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs) are all central figures in marketing, often the
                    technology they promise can even fall behind them in marketing importance
                    ([[NEUR421-Assignment-WhatTechCallsThinking.pdf]],
                    https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/23/1107291/the-cult-of-tech/). But also this exceptionalism is
                    also internally oriented, in company culture and almost ritualistic practices found
                    within(https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/23/1107291/the-cult-of-tech/).

                Both the innovative velocity that the market incentives (every start-up must be game-changing), but also the cult of genius that is engendered into silicon valley culture, should be contrasted with the culture, logic, and goals of scientific research. Science is slow and incremental, it is a very conservative philosophy of knowledge, "wait until you can prove it, twice, three times..., then your neighbour must prove it once, twice, three times...". Science is also a collective effort, in its ideal it is a self-correcting and ego-less process. This is in direct contrast with the cult of genius, and self-exceptionalism that is in the DNA of big-tech. If the scientific field is within the market field (big-tech market field), then it is influenced by two antagonistic logics. A conservative, scientific method vs the logic of innovation and genius. This too raises questions of epistemic validity, if the field of science is under influence from the tech-industry (funding and culture), our trust in the knowledge it produces should reflect that.
